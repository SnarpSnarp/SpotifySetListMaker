# SpotifySetListMaker
```
This tools creates a spotify playlist based on a artist name and MBID number.
It is meant to give a discography closer to a concert would bring rather than 
simply what is most listened to online.

You need to fill out Key.py file with your api keys inside
You will need a setlist.fm api key and a spotify developer client id and secret. 
The redirect url for your spotify app should be set to 'http://localhost:8888/callback/'
This was made in 2 hours. I then synced away half the program. So technically 3.

Added functionality to mass delete tracks from a chosen
playlist and delete playlist through the application.
